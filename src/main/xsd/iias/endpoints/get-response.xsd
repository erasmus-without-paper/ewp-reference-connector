                                        A list of HEIs participating in this IIA.

                                        This list includes the local HEI which MUST be the first element on this list.
                                        In other words:

                                        * The value of `hei-id` of the first `partner` MUST match the value passed in
                                          the `hei_id` request parameter,

                                        * Both `iia-id` and `iia-code` elements MUST be present in the first `partner`
                                          element (even though it's not required by the schema itself), and one of them
                                          MUST match one of the values passed in the `iia_id` or `iia_code` request
                                          parameter.

                                        * The server will usually fill much more data for the first `partner`, and the
                                          data on all other partners will be often much more limited.

                                                    Clients can retrieve further information on this HEI via Institutions API, but
                                                    note, that it is not obvious *which* Institutions API the client should use. If
                                                    this HEI is already a member of EWP Network, then it's probably best to request
                                                    information directly from this HEI's hosts. However, if it is NOT a member of
                                                    EWP yet, then clients may request information from Institutions API served by
                                                    the same EWP Host which has given them this ID (servers are required to provide
                                                    some basic data on all institutions known to them via their Institutions API).

                                                    Optional organizational unit surrogate ID. If given, then it refers to the unit
                                                    within the partner HEI's organizational structure, which is the actual partner
                                                    of this agreement. Agreements can be signed between units, not only between
                                                    HEIs: https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-iias/issues/11

                                                    If provided, then it MUST have the value of the "official" ounit-id, exactly as
                                                    it has been assigned by the *partner HEI* in its Organizational Units API. If
                                                    this official ID is not known by the server (and it often isn't), then this
                                                    element MUST be skipped. This is a surrogate ID, so it SHOULD NOT be displayed
                                                    to the user (use `ounit-code` for that).

                                                    The partner's unique surrogate ID of this IIA. This is a surrogate ID, so it
                                                    SHOULD NOT be displayed to the user (use `iia-code` for that).

                                                    Since IIA IDs are local (unique within a single HEI, but not within the world),
                                                    each partner is allowed to have his own ID for the same IIA. If this server is
                                                    aware of the IDs used by the other partners, then it outputs it here.

                                                    Server implementers MUST use immutable surrogate keys for their work with EWP.

                                                    The partner's "human readable" ID of this IIA (aka an agreement number). If
                                                    this server is aware of the agreement numbers used by the other partners, then
                                                    it outputs it here.

                                                    Since `iia-id` values should contain surrogate identifiers (and, as such,
                                                    should not be displayed to the user), we require additional "human readable"
                                                    agreement codes/numbers to be provided here. These codes SHOULD be displayed to
                                                    the user, and they MAY be used for searching, but they are *not used* to
                                                    directly identify entities in EWP network.

                                                    Only some servers provide these, even for the *local* partner. Many HEIs
                                                    (especially the smaller ones) don't granulate their contacts in such a detailed
                                                    way. Instead, they have a fixed set of contacts described in their Institutions
                                                    API.

                                                    These contacts take precedence over contacts defined in the Institutions API

    <xs:complexType name="MobilitySpecification" abstract="true">
        <xs:annotation>
            <xs:documentation>
                A common parent class for all mobility specifications.

                Note that "mobility specification" is a name we (EWP designers) made up. We
                needed to have a descriptive name for this particular entity, and we couldn't
                find such name in existing Erasmus+ templates. In other words, this is an
                EWP-specific term only, and you should probably avoid using it in other
                contexts.

                Mobility specification may also be considered as a subclass of "cooperation
                condition", but - since currently all nonabstract subclasses inherit from
                MobilitySpecification - no CooperationCondition class is introduced. See here:
                https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-wp3-data-model/issues/10

                Each specification has a sending and receiving partner. Each specification
                represents an agreement that, for each of the academic years listed within, the
                sending partner will send a particular number of people to the receiving
                partner, for a particular average duration each (e.g. for 8 weeks). This
                describes an unidirectional flow - if people are sent in both directions, two
                separate mobility specifications need to be defined (one for each direction).

                More requirements (e.g. *who* is being sent to do *what*) are defined in
                specific `*-mobility-spec` subclasses.

                This type, nor any of its subclasses, SHOULD NOT be referenced outside of the
                EWP IIAs API. It is likely to be modified, or to be removed, in the future.

                        This data might be relevant for some partners, while other partners might
                        ignore it completely. If the server is aware that particular students should
                        come from a particular organizational unit, then it reports it here. Note, that
                        this MAY be the "root" unit (the one representing the entire HEI).

                        These IDs are defined by the HEI referred to in the `sending-hei-id` element.
                        If the server is not aware of these IDs, then it won't provide them. Clients
                        can retrieve further information on this unit via Organizational Units API, but
                        note, that it is not obvious *which* Organizational Units API the client should
                        use. See similar notes on `iia/partner-hei/hei-id` element. Discuss here:

                        on this specification.

                        Not all servers provide these! Many HEIs (especially the smaller ones) don't
                        granulate their contacts in such a detailed way. Instead, they have a fixed set
                        of contacts described in their Institutions API.

                        These contacts take precedence over contacts defined in the Institutions API,
                        and the ones defined in the `contact` elements of *this* API (outside of the
                        cooperation conditions list). Clients are advised to display these contacts in
                        a separate section above other contacts - so that the users will notice them
                        first (before scrolling down to other, more generic contacts).

                        A list of academic years for which this mobility specification is required to
                        be in effect. (Each mobility specification can be bound to a different set of
                        academic years.) It MUST be a unique set of IDs (years are not allowed to be
                        repeated).

                        Data models of some servers allow for a mobility specification to be in effect
                        for an infinite number of years - this happens if the agreement doesn't have an
                        end date yet. In such cases, it is RECOMMENDED for server implementers to use a
                        "best guess" strategy to determine the end date. If you cannot guess reliably,
                        then it is RECOMMENDED to include *at least* all academic years from *now* to 5
                        years into the future.

                        If some of the partners are from the southern hemisphere (so that they use
                        academic years in a form of "2010/2010" instead of "2010/2011"), then IDs
                        provided here should refer to the scheme used by the receiving partner (not the
                        sending one). At the beginning of the EWP project clients MAY expect all
                        academic years to come in the northern hemisphere format, but this might change
                        later on.

                        Optional ISCED-F subject area code associated with this mobility.

                        This element can currently be attached to all subclasses of
                        MobilitySpecification. Since it has almost the same meaning regardless of where
                        it is attached, we define it here (in the base class) for now. This MAY change
                        in future versions though.

                        ISCED-F codes define fields of education and training at the secondary,
                        post-secondary and tertiary levels of education. Details:

                                Note, that Erasmus+ IIA template allows to give this value in two formats:

                                A. a total number of months of the study periods, or
                                B. an average duration.

                                Since A can be easily calculated from B (A=B*N, where N is the
                                `mobilities-per-year`), we do not need to support both formats here. We
                                chose to support B only.

                                This is very similar to `avg-months` element (please read the notes there too).
                                Note, that Erasmus+ IIA template defines student mobility periods in months, but
                                staff mobility periods are always defined in days (that's why neither
                                `avg-months` nor `avg-days` can be present on the MobilitySpecification level).
