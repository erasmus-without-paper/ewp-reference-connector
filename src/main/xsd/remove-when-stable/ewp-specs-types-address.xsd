            <xs:documentation>
                This type defines an address. It can be used for postal/mailing address,
                or for street/physical address, or both, depending on context.

                <xs:annotation>
                    <xs:documentation>
                        The name of the addressed entity (usually a person), formatted in a way
                        suitable to be printed on an envelope.
                    </xs:documentation>

            <!-- The "choice" section -->

            <xs:choice>
                <xs:annotation>
                    <xs:documentation>
                        This detailed section of the address can be provided in one of two ways -
                        either the structural way, or as a plain addressLine sequence.

                        Server implementers are encouraged to TRY to provide this data in a structural
                        way, but if they encounter any problems with that (e.g. missing fields in the
                        "advanced format" section), then it is perfectly okay to format their data in
                        the simpler addressLine format.
                    </xs:documentation>
                </xs:annotation>
                <xs:sequence>
                    <xs:element name="addressLine" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="4" type="xs:string">
                        <xs:annotation>
                            <xs:documentation>
                                OPTION 1. The simple format. A denormalized sequence of addressLines.
                                Each line is formatted with all of its pieces in their proper place. This
                                includes all of the necessary punctuation.

                                This form of address is not intended to be parsed, it is used for delivery by
                                the postal service. They usually contain information such as street name,
                                building number, building name (such as the name of a faculty), a post-office
                                box number, etc. They SHOULD NOT contain values defined in `locality`,
                                `postalCode`, `region` and `country` (you should provide those in their
                                respective elements).

                                It is recommended for server developers to provide this data in a form of
                                multiple lines. However, it is also allowed to have it all in a single line
                                (comma-separated). Same goes for client developers - if their database doesn't
                                accept multiple lines for some reason, they MAY combine the lines with commas
                                before storing them. (Such concatenated strings might not look as pretty, but
                                they will still be usable for mailing.)

                        <xs:documentation>
                            OPTION 2. The advanced format.

                            This format is based on OAGIS standard for Address, version 9, and it
                            "inherits" its documentation. This means that developers may consult OAGIS
                            documentation when in doubt.

                            Please note however, that we *do not* reuse the standard in its exact form - we
                            have named the elements in very similar fashion, but we have placed them in a
                            namespace of our own, we also use our own data types, and we are introducing
                            only a selected subset of OAGIS Address features. See the following GitHub
                            thread for more reasoning on that:

                                The number of the building or house on the street that identifies where to
                                deliver mail.

                                The building or house name on the street that identifies where to deliver mail.

                                In some areas of the world, including many remote areas, houses are not
                                numbered but named. Some buildings also have both - a number and a name (in
                                this cases it is usually enough to submit only one of them).

                        characters. Note, that in some countries it can be as long as 10 characters.

                        If this address is supposed to be postal address, then it is recommended to use

                        Note however, that a map locality is also acceptable, as the postal code will
                        usually resolve any problems here, to allow correct delivery even if the
                        official postal locality is not used.
